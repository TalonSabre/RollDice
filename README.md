This app was built in Android Studio while learning Kotlin.

Code can be found in .kt files found [here](/app/src/main/java/com/cpw/rollthedice).

Layouts are located in .xml files in the [layout](/app/src/main/res/layout) folder.

The animation is in the [roll.xml](/app/src/main/res/anim/roll.xml) file.

The final product is nothing special, but it was a fun project nonetheless.
  I'm happy with how it looks for what it is.
  
Still, I won't be changing this app again anytime soon.
  It is here for reference and preservation.
